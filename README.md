# Fitness Tracker

## Task 2 

***What will the application do?***

The fitness application will assist users in achieving their health related goals. It will keep track of
the foods consumed, and the physical activities performed during the day of the user. Based off of that information the
application will calculate the amount of calories the person has expended/consumed. A summary of how the app will run
is given below.
 
How the app will run:
- On Start, the app will ask users for their name, height, age, weight, gender and their goals.
- The app will then calculate a recommended daily calorie intake required to reach their goals.
- Users will then be able to add foods eaten to breakfast,lunch or snack categories.
- Users will also be able to add the physical activities they performed.

***Who will use it?***

People who want to make a healthy change in their lifestyle and want an application which can keep track
of their progress and make sure they can stick to their goals. 

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

Ever since COVID-19 I found that it has been increasingly difficult to achieve the same amount of physical activity in
any given day compared to pre COVID times. This is in part due to the fact that classes have been moved online which 
meant that I often found myself sitting at my desk for hours on end. By making a health app, I hope I can promote
people to strive towards a healthier lifestyle even during times like this.
