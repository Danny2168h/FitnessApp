# 2D Portal

## Task 2 

***What will the application do?***

The Portal first person puzzle game was originally released in 2007 with a sequel released in 2011.
At the core of the game, the player is tasked with completing puzzle utilizing teleportation enabled by
two linked portals. A 2D platformer version of this game would aim to adhere to the underlying principals
and gameplay mechanics, but in a 2D format.

The properties of the portals can be summarized below:
 
Properties of portals:
- Portals are intialized when its corresponding projectile contacts a surface.
- Portals therefore cannot be created through another portal.
- Teleportation between the two portals are instantaneous.
- Momentum of the player is preserved when crossing between portals.
- However, the players momentum is converted in the direction of the normal vector to the portal.

***Who will use it?***

Anyone who has an interest in puzzle games.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

The Portal series was one of the first games I ever played on my computer. I was fascinated by the concept
of the portals but also the plot and story of the game itself. I am quite interested in game development
and wanted to choose a project that would allow me to explore that path.
